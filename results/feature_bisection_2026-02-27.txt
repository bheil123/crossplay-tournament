=== FEATURE BISECTION TEST ===
Date: 2026-02-27
Seeds: 743081093, 725414342, 1915759923 (from original tournament master seed 700847761)
Base config: standard tier N=30, K=1500, ES_SE=0.8, ES_MIN=80

All tests use identical tile draws (same seeds). Differences are purely from code.

| Config                    | W-L | Spread  | Delta from baseline |
|---------------------------|-----|---------|---------------------|
| Baseline (no features)    | 3-0 | +107.3  | --                  |
| + BLANK_3PLY              | 3-0 | +107.3  | 0 (neutral)         |
| + BLOCKER_CANDIDATES (5)  | 2-1 | +14.0   | -93.3               |
| + EXCHANGE_MC (top 3)     | 1-2 | +10.0   | -97.3               |
| + REAL_RISK (top 5)       | 1-2 | -51.7   | -159.0              |
| All features (tournament) | 4-16| -97.5   | -204.8 (20 games)   |

Conclusion: REAL_RISK, EXCHANGE_MC, and BLOCKER_CANDIDATES all degrade play.
BLANK_3PLY is neutral. Bugs likely in implementation, not concept.
